	<h2>10 Tips For Safe Computer Use</h2>
	<hr>
	<h3>#1 Practice Safe Browsing</h3>
	<img class="img" src="images/health1.png">
	<p>
		You wouldn't choose to walk through a dangerous neighborhood, don't visit dangerous neighborhoods online. One careless click could expose personal data or infect your device with malware. By resisting the urge, you don't even give the hackers a chance.
	</p>
	<hr>
	<h3>#2 Watch What You Download</h3>
	<img class="img" src="images/health2.jpg">
	<p>
		A top goal of cybercriminals is to trick you into downloading malware programs or apps that carry malware or try to steal information. This malware can be disguised as an app: anything from a popular game to something that checks traffic or the weather.
	</p>
	<hr>
	<h3>#3 Choose Strong Passwords</h3>
	<img class="img" src="images/health3.jpg" style="width: 30%;">
	<p>
		A weak password is a weak defence against hackers. Don't make it easy for people to steal from you.
	</p>
	<hr>
	<h3>#4 Have a Good Anitvirus Software</h3>
	<img class="img" src="images/health4.jpg" style="width: 30%;">
	<p>
		Internet security software cannot protect against every threat, but it will detect and remove most malware. Ensure that you have reliable Antivirus software installed on your computer.  
	</p>
	<hr>
	<h3>#5 Look Away From the Screen</h3>
	<img class="img" src="images/health5.jpg" style="width: 30%;">
	<p>
		Eye strain and progressive vision loss are common side effects of looking at a screen too long. Take breaks often by looking out a window or closing your eyes. 
	</p>
	<hr>
	<h3>#6 Don't Aim With Yout Wrist</h3>
	<img class="img" src="images/health6.png">
	<p>
		If you aim and move your mouse around with your wrist, you may develop joint problems or carpal tunnel syndrome. Experienced gamers and computer users know that you must use your entire arm to move the mouse. 
	</p>
	<hr>
	<h3>#7 Make Sure Your Monitor Is At The Proper Level</h3>
	<img class="img" src="images/health7.jpg">
	<p>
		Make sure your monitor is exactly eye level so you are not forced to look up or down. Neck problems are a nasty side effect of an unadjusted monitor. 
	</p>
	<hr>
	<h3>#8 Stretch Your Legs</h3>
	<img class="img" src="images/health8.jpg" style="width: 30%;">
	<p>
		Sitting at a computer all day is not very healthy or active. Get up and stretch your legs often to avoid cramps, atrophy, weight gain, and blood clots. 
	</p>
	<hr>
	<h3>#9 Practice Good Posture</h3>
	<img class="img" src="images/health9.jfif">
	<p>
		Do not slouch or lean close to the computer. Keep your back straight against the back of your chair with a relaxed neck. Improper posture can lead to spine problems. 
	</p>
	<hr>
	<h3>#10 Adjust Your Seat</h3>
	<img class="img" src="images/health10.jpg">
	<p>
		If possible, adjust your seat so your feet are flat on the ground and your thighs are parallel to the floor. 
	</p>
