	<h2>Should Smartphones be Allowed in Class?</h2>
	<p>
		This article addresses the issue of smartphone use in the classroom. In September 2019, cell phones were banned in all Ontario classrooms during instructional time. Some people support this ban while others think it is unnecessary. Some pros of smartphone use are that it lets students use learning applications or other digital platforms and they make access to information easier. However, smartphones can also be a distraction if the students choose to watch YouTube all day. These devices can also be used in advanced cheating schemes. Because there are good and bad aspects of phone use in class, it is difficult to say whether they are good or bad. Teachers should use their own personal judgment in deciding whether a smartphone would help or hurt students learning.
