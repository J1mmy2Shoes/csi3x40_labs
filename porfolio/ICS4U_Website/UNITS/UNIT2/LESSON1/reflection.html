		To finish off this project, computer science is a rapidly expanding field with a great many job options. Technology is becoming more advanced every year, as well as our depedence on it. Jetpacks are a good example of how something that was once thought to be impossible is now close to becoming a reality. Hopefully, technology can advance to a point where it can solve our enviromental problems by cleaning up trash with a revolutionary app. Becsaue of all this, computer science is an amaxing field with many job prospects and opportunities to make a difference in the world.
