	<h2>Should Smartphones be Alowed in Class?</h2>
	<p>
		This article adresses the issue of smartphone use in the clasroom. In september 2019, cell phones were banned in all Ontario classrooms during instuctional time. Some people support this ban while others think it is unneccesary. Some pros of smartphone use are that it lets students use learning applications or other digital platforms, as well as making access to information easier. Howerver, smarphones can also be a distraction if the students choose to watch YouTube all day. These devices can also be used in advanced cheating schemes. Becasue there are good and bad aspects of phone use in class, it is difficult to say whether they are good or bad. Teachers should use their own personal judgment if deciding whether a smarthohne would help or hurt a students learning.
